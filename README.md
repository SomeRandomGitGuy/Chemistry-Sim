# Chemistry-Sim

A Chemistry Simulation written by me, SomeRandomGitGuy

ChatGPT was used for:

- Information on how the chemistry should work
- Basic rules/formulas to govern the chemistry
- But no actual code was taken from AI

## Basic Information

### RCS

<details>
    <summary>	RCS.js is the first version of the simulation, featuring only </summary>
    <ul>
	<li>Spring based physics</li>
	<li>Ionic Bonding</li>
	<li>Only a set amount of atoms</li>
	</ul>
</details>

### RCS++

**RCS++.js** is the most recent, and updated version, featuring:

- Ionic bonding, compatable with multiple of one atom
  - Uses Coloumbs law for bonding physics
- Covalent bonding, but without Coordinate Covalent Bonds
  - Uses Hooke's law spring physics for the bonding
- Metallic bonding
  - Also uses spring physics
- Expanded octets for Covalent bonding

**Possibly upcoming features**

- Light (Electromagnetic spectrum)
- Some added hard-coded logic for atoms like silicon and their bonding habits
