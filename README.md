# Chemistry-Sim

A Chemistry Simulation written by me, SomeRandomGitGuy

ChatGPT was used for:

- Information on how the chemistry should work
- Basic rules/formulas to govern the chemistry
- But no actual code was taken from AI

## Basic Information

<details>
    <summary>**RCS.js** is the first version of the simulation, featuring only: </summary>

    - Spring based physics
    - Ionic Bonding
    - Only Sodium and Chlorine

</details>
### RCS++

**RCS++.js** is the most recent, and updated version, featuring:

- Ionic bonding, compatable with multiple of one atom
  - Uses Coloumbs law for bonding physics
- Covalent bonding, but without Coordinate Covalent Bonds
  - Uses Hooke's law spring physics for the bonding
- Metallic bonding
  - Also uses spring physics
- Expanded octets for Covalent bonding

**Possibly upcoming features**

- Light (Electromagnetic spectrum)
- Some added hard-coded logic for atoms like silicon and their bonding habits
